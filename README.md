# 3D-Cube

Welcome to the 3D Cube project! This is a simple JavaScript program that creates a 3D cube using HTML and CSS transformations.

How it works

The 3D Cube is created using six div elements, each representing a face of the cube. The faces are positioned using CSS transformations and perspective, giving the illusion of a 3D cube. The cube can be rotated using mouse or touch events, which update the CSS transformations dynamically.
